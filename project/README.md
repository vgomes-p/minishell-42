```
> Notes: Bash does not treat `exit` with an invalid argument as an error; it just states that the argument is invalid and exits anyway. However, some other shells handle it differently (they return an error for the invalid argument and do not close the program). Check if the group has handled this case. If they haven't, it is **NOT** a reason to reject their Minishell, since the subject states that we must use Bash as a reference.
